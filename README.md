Some Notes:

- To save time I created the project with create-react-app
- The RecipeFinder container component is the home page of the project which renders The SearchBar and the RecipeList components
- The RecipeDetails component shows the details of each recipe and clicking on it opens the RecipeModal container. 
- I couldn't finish changing the url path when the modal is open so I commented out the code
- And the font awesome's icon appears as a square instead of a heart. I spent some time on it but moved on to adding more features instead of debugging.
